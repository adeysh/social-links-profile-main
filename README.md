## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Learned about guessing the sizes through design pictures provided.

- Learned about how I can layout elements from top-to-bottom without fixing the container lenghts like width and height.

### Continued development

- I get confused about structuring the depth of the elements in the design and make it complex which I want to avoid from now on.
